            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>We Give Back</h1><p>Sustainable relationships with the farmers is the foundation of our philosophy. This means helping them improve their crop to ensure quality coffee is produced consistently, keeping them in business.Â Responsible sourcing, the environment, quality, and you, the customer, come first which is why we take pride and care in ensuring that every green bean is bought directly from quality committed farmers at a more than fair rate via Project Origin & Chapola Project. The farmers we do business with are well compensated above market standards so that every green bean produced is grown with love and all our coffees taste exquisite.</p></article>]]></description>
