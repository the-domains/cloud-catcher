Cloud Catcher started from scratch by tracing the green beans back to its origins and learning how they are treated as young saplings in the nursery, choosing the right soil, harvesting, sorting, blending, roasting, cupping and scoring based on taste. Every step in the production of a good of coffee is interrelated, you need good brewing skills, an exceptional roast profile and, of course, un-compromised farming techniques at the source (soil, climate, selective picking, processing, etc)'

### Seed to Cup

The understanding of how good coffee is made is a long, tedious, continuous but fun process. Cloud Catcher started from scratch by tracing the green beans back to its origins and learning how they are treated as young saplings in the nursery, choosing the right soil, harvesting, sorting, blending, roasting, cupping and scoring based on taste. Every step in the production of a good of coffee is interrelated, you need good brewing skills, an exceptional roast profile and, of course, un-compromised farming techniques at the source (soil, climate, selective picking, processing, etc)
